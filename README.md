A lazy way to create editable static html-pages.

## Motivation
_**TL;DR:** This repository is designed to help you easily add large amounts of text to static pages._

Let's say you have a popular Telegram channel. From time to time, users ask you the same questions and you are forced to answer them every time. Again and again.

A good reason to create a simple FAQ page, place it on free hosting and fix the link to this page in the header of the Telegram channel. Perhaps this will help a little to keep the mood in good condition.
However, adding a large amount of text to an html-page is quite tedious.

Now you have two annoying issues.

There may be other options why you need a simple html-page with a lot of text.

To create static pages, of course, you can use popular solutions such as [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) or [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). But these solutions seem a bit overkill for such a simple task.
