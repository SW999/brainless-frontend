"<h2>Motivation</h2><p><strong><em>TL;DR:</em></strong><em> This repository is designed to help you easily add large amounts of text to static pages.</em></p><p>There can be many reasons why you need a simple html-page with lots of text.</p><p>Let's say you have a popular Telegram channel. From time to time, users ask you the same questions and you are forced to answer them every time. Again and again.</p><p>A good reason to create a simple FAQ page, place it on free hosting and fix the link to this page in the header of the Telegram channel. Perhaps this will help a little to keep the mood in good condition. However, adding a large amount of text to an html-page is quite tedious.</p><p>Now you have two annoying issues.</p><p>To create static pages, of course, you can use popular solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby</a> or <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NextJS</a>. But these solutions seem a bit overkill for such a simple task.</p><p>With this repository, you can create <em>simple editable html-pages</em> with less headache.</p><h2>How to use</h2><ul><li>Clone repo</li><li>Install dependencies</li></ul><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm i\n</pre><ul><li>Edit file '<strong><em>client/public/index.html</em></strong>' to update the title, description and so on</li></ul>"
