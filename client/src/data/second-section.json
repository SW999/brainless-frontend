"<h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This application does not use Typescript, tests or linters. These things save a lot of time on large projects, but this is clearly too much for a static site for a couple of pages.</p><p>If for some reason, you need them, then you can easily set up them yourself. But in this case, I would recommend you consider frameworks such as <strong>Gatsby</strong> and <strong>NextJs</strong>.</p>"
